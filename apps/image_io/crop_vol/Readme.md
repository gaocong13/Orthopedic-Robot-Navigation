# Volume Cropping
This tool takes as input a volume and an axis aligned rectangular region of interest (ROI) and outputs a cropped version of the input according to the ROI.

An example of this tool's use is given in the walkthrough [here](https://github.com/rg2/xreg/wiki/Walkthrough%3A-Volume-Cropping).
