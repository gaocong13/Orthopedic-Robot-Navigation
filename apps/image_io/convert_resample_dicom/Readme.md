# DICOM Conversion and Resampling
This program provides some functionality for converting a collection of DICOM series into volume file formats, such as NIFTI (.nii, .nii.gz), MHD (.mhd,.mha), or NRRD (.nrrd).
Optionally, the data may also be resampled to user-specified pixel spacings.
Pass `-h` or `--help` to print out a detailed usage description.

Several examples of this tool are given in the walkthrough [here](https://github.com/rg2/xreg/wiki/Walkthrough%3A-DICOM-Conversion).
