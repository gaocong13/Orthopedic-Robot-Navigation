# X-ray Scene Visualization
This tool provides an interactive 3D visualization of the projective geometries of a projection images (X-ray, fluoroscopy, etc.).
Other objects, such as surface meshes and point clouds, may also be added to the scene.

A comprehensive listing of the program's usage may be obtained by passing `-h` or `--help`.

## Examples
Several examples of this tool are given in the walkthrough sections for:
* [Synthetic Fluoroscopy Creation](https://github.com/rg2/xreg/wiki/Walkthrough%3A-Simulated-Fluoroscopy)
* [Single-View Pelvis Registration](https://github.com/rg2/xreg/wiki/Walkthrough%3A-Single-View-Pelvis-Registration)
