/// \brief General class for intensity-based 2D/3D registration.
///
/// The type of images are implicitly defined by the choice of ray caster and
/// similarity metric. For example, a line integral ray caster may be set to
/// indicate that this is a 2D/3D X-Ray registration, or a surface ray caster
/// may be set to indicate a 2D/3D camera registration.
/// This method provides a generic interface that must be completed in a derived
/// class. The derived class will typically wrap an interface to some other
/// optimizer.
///
/// The number of views is equal to the number of similarity metrics used. If
/// only rigid pose is being optimized over, then the number of cameras in the
/// ray caster should be equal to the number of views. When the camera source,
/// or entire projection matrix, is being optimized over, then the number of
/// cameras in the ray caster must be equal to the total number of projections
/// being computed over all views (e.g. each projection has its own camera model).
///
/// TODO: Add some pure virtual methods that the derived classes must implement
///       to indicate the current, best, pose and associated similarity metric.
/// TODO: Allow a different SE3 parameterization per volume
